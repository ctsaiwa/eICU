# eICU
Sample SQL queries and sample data

This is the repository for code samples used to develop a web-based large scale patient monitoring dashboard at Stony Brook University Hospital at Stony Brook, NY as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because it is developed to utilize exisiting resources commonly available for data abstration and reporting (Tableau and Cerner EHR) at hospitals, we believe it can help many facilities to ramp up their patient care capability without having to invest in a commercial eICU solution.


We have included sample SQL queries for encounter-level informaiton, vital signs, and laboratory results.
We also included sample data that is used for data aggregation for reporting.


The Jupyter notebook contains all 3 sets of SQL queries into 1 file.
